# lovescript-prototype

This is a set of prototype examples for lovescript.

Lovescript is an experiment to distill the essential protocol.love information interface of a real-world agreement/contract.

## Goal

To explore the interfaces to protocol.love using techniques such as
[Domain Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), 
[semi-structured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-structured_data),
paper prototyping, diagrams, etc.

## Why?

A purpose of automated tooling is to facilitate existing manual processes by reducing repetitive work,
    tracking information in real-time, & providing logical feedback on the design of a system. 

To work with automated tools, one must interact with a set of interfaces.
There are various interfaces in a process & software stack.

This repo is an exercise to understand how the protocol.love api is used in service of real-world agreements & contracts.
Examples of the protocol.love api being used in a stepwise & semi-formal fashion will demonstrate the veracity of the
    protocol.love api concept and to root out architectural misunderstandings & bugs in the api & process itself.

### Separation of Concerns

The profession of Software Engineering has discovered patterns to reduce risk, increase applicability of software,
    increase productivity (short, medium, & long term), & increase the ability to manage complexity.
Separation of concerns is a pattern/strategy to manage complexity, reduce risk, increase applicability of software,
    & increase productivity in certain cases.

In the context of protocol.love, separating the concerns of agreement design & tracking from "currentsee" exchange,
    we will be able to contribute more value to the public ecosystem & further enhance our goals of 
    "vulnerable transparency" by increasing the applicability & de-risking certain aspects of participating 
    individuals & collectives (entities).

## Existing work

See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13gwZp_jv9m76Ga3-4j68P-evyVByZjawVAyH3TU4kyw for using Google Docs to track the design of an agreement.

## Process

The syntax is experimental & example driven to explore the syntax.
