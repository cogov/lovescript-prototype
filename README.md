# lovescript-prototype

This is a set of prototype examples for lovescript.

Lovescript is an experiment to distill the essential protocol.love information interface of a real-world agreement/contract.

## Goal

To explore minimalist manual interfaces to protocol.love using techniques such as
[Domain Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), 
[semi-structured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-structured_data),
paper prototyping, diagrams, etc.

## Existing work

See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13gwZp_jv9m76Ga3-4j68P-evyVByZjawVAyH3TU4kyw for using Google Docs to track the design of an agreement.

## Process

The syntax is experimental & example driven to explore the syntax.
